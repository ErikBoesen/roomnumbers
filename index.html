            <p>Full numbering rules (paraphrased from <a href="https://facilities.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Room%20and%20Floor%20Numbering.pdf">Yale University Central & West Campus 2009 Room & Floor Numbering Process</a>):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Student living spaces in the residential college facilities are numbered with
                    reference to the entryway by which access is provided, with distinctions made for
                    numbers on each floor. For example, rooms accessed by entryway ‘B’ on the first
                    floor would be numbered B10, B11, B12, rooms on the second floor would be
                    numbered B20, B21, B22, etc.</li>
                <li>Individual rooms off a main suite are designated with a letter following the suite number.
                    For example, a room off of suite B22 may be called B22A, B22B, etc.</li>
                <li>Student living spaces that can be accessed by two different entryways and are
                    designated as “flexible” suites by the college would have a double prefix such as
                    AB, BC, CD. Typical room numbers would be AB1, AB2, etc. Rooms off the main suite
                    would be AB1A for example. Students in the suite might only see the
                    suffix noted on the doors within the suite.</li>
                <li>Other areas within the residential college facilities would follow the normal
                    numbering convention for academic and administrative buildings.</li>
